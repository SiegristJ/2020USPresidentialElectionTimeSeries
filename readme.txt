2020 US Election Time Series data
This repository contains two sets of data and a few scripts. Based on election coverage from TheGatewayPundit, one of the users of the thedonald.win forum performed some data analysis on the 2020 election data and identified a lot of missing votes. Along with this analysis were a few scripts used for processing that data. What is included in this source repository is an independently-fetched copy of the Presidential election data and the Senate race data for independent/separate analysis. The original data sets posted by TrumanBlack are included in this repository for comparison and for archival purposes.

For some odd reason, there is no Senate race data available for Arizona.
